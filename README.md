# Recommender-System
This work design Recommender system for movies using the following methods:
1. Popularity-Based.
2. Content-Based:
  Jaccard Similarity - Based.
  TF-IDF Content Based
3. Pearson Item-Based.
4. Cosine_Similarity-Based.
5. Collaborative Filtering: KNN User and Item Based.
6. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) via Matrix Factorization.
7. Evaluation of the SVD rating.

A Recommender evaluation algorithm was also designed.
